## Artwork

### Logo

I get logos from [Brand of the World](http://www.brandsoftheworld.com). They should be solid white with no layer effects.


### Hero Image

I Google around (setting the greater than 1024x768 option helps a lot) for a cool image for the company. Usually I search for something like "Apple headquarters." Resize the image to 640x420 and apply a gaussian blur with a 6px radius.

Make sure the the image isn't too light since a white logo will go on top. Sometime, I apply a black layer on top with 3â€“5% opacity.


### TODO

* Figure out maximum logo size.
* Disney's image is kinda crappy.
* Bank of America is also pretty crappy.

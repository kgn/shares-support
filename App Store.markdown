## Description

Understanding your portfolio just became ridiculously simple. You don't need a 20 page report just to see how much you've made or lost.

Shares makes it easy to track your stocks and simply see your gains today, overall, and the overall value. It's perfect if you're new to owning stocks or if you just want a dead simple way to see your gains and losses.

Add shares you've already purchased with their price and quantity and Shares will show you how much you've made at a glance. Simple as that.

If you have stocks in multiple countries, Shares will show your total in whatever currency you want. Exchange rates are kept up to date automatically for you.

Shares works with New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market, London Stock Exchange, Euronext, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Berlin Stock Exchange, Stuttgart Stock Exchange, München Stock Exhange, Düsseldorf Stock Exhange, Australian Securities Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, BM&F Bovespa, Korea Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Moscow Exchange, Taiwan Stock Exchange, and OTC Markets. 157 currencies are supported.
